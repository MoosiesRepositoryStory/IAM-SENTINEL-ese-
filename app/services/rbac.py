"""Role-based access control — pure role logic (§10.2, Phase 4 Slice 2).

Three global roles — read_only < analyst < admin, not per-account. This
module is deliberately dependency-free (stdlib only): it's imported by plain
service modules (``exception_service``, ``connect_service``) for their
defense-in-depth re-checks, and those modules must stay importable without
the ``api`` extra (Flask-Login etc.) installed — the base `iam-sentinel`
install only pulls in Flask itself, not Flask-Login. The Flask-specific route
decorator that also belongs to "RBAC" lives in ``app.web.authz`` instead,
which *does* depend on Flask/Flask-Login and is only ever imported from
``app/web/*``.

Enforcement happens in two independent layers per the spec's "defense in
depth" mandate:

1. **Route layer** (``app.web.authz.require_role``): every mutating route is
   decorated with the minimum role it needs. This is the primary gate — it
   runs before any service code, denies with 403, and writes an
   ``access_denied`` ``audit_event``.
2. **Service layer** (this module's :func:`at_least`, used directly inside
   ``exception_service.create_exception`` and ``connect_service.connect_account``):
   the two capabilities where a role split exists *within* an otherwise-shared
   code path — accepting risk (admin) vs. every other exception/workflow
   action (analyst), and connecting an account (admin) — independently
   re-verify the role inside the service function itself. That's what
   "defense in depth" buys: even if some future caller (a bug, a new API
   endpoint in Slice 4) reaches these functions without going through the
   decorated route, an unauthorized accept-risk or account-connect still
   can't happen.

Both layers read from the same :class:`Capability` table, so they can't drift
apart.

**Convention used throughout this slice:** role-aware service functions take
an optional ``actor_role: str | None`` parameter defaulting to ``None`` —
meaning "trusted internal caller, no check performed." This mirrors the
posture ``actor_id: int | None = None`` already has elsewhere in this
codebase for system-triggered calls (e.g. ``expire_exceptions``'s daily
auto-reopen has no human actor at all). Every *real* entry point (a route)
always passes the actual ``current_user.role``; only test/internal callers
that aren't exercising authorization omit it — which also means adding this
parameter didn't require touching the dozens of pre-existing unit tests that
call these functions directly to test unrelated business logic.
